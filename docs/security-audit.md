# Security Audit Report

## Overview

This document outlines the findings and recommendations from a security audit conducted on the Collaborative Code Platform.

## Findings and Recommendations

### 1. Authentication and Authorization

- [x] Implement proper password hashing (using bcrypt)
- [x] Implement JWT for session management
- [ ] Implement password complexity requirements
- [ ] Implement account lockout after multiple failed login attempts
- [ ] Implement two-factor authentication

### 2. Input Validation and Sanitization

- [ ] Implement input validation for all user inputs
- [ ] Sanitize user inputs before storing in the database or using in queries
- [ ] Implement output encoding to prevent XSS attacks

### 3. API Security

- [x] Implement rate limiting
- [x] Implement CSRF protection
- [ ] Implement proper error handling to avoid information leakage
- [ ] Implement API versioning

### 4. Data Protection

- [x] Implement encryption for sensitive data at rest
- [ ] Implement proper key management for encryption keys
- [ ] Implement data backup and recovery procedures

### 5. Dependency Management

- [ ] Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities
- [ ] Implement a process for monitoring and addressing security advisories for dependencies

### 6. Logging and Monitoring

- [ ] Implement comprehensive logging for security-relevant events
- [ ] Implement real-time monitoring and alerting for suspicious activities

### 7. Secure Development Practices

- [ ] Implement secure coding guidelines
- [ ] Conduct regular security training for developers
- [ ] Implement a security review process for code changes

## Action Items

1. Implement password complexity requirements
2. Implement account lockout mechanism
3. Enhance input validation and sanitization across the application
4. Improve error handling in API responses
5. Implement proper key management for encryption keys
6. Set up a process for regular dependency updates and security patch management
7. Enhance logging and monitoring capabilities
8. Develop and enforce secure coding guidelines

## Conclusion

While the Collaborative Code Platform has implemented several important security measures, there are still areas that need improvement. Addressing the action items listed above will significantly enhance the overall security posture of the application.
