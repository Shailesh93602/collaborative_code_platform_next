# Code Review and Refactoring Guidelines

## Code Review Process

1. **Pull Request Creation**

   - Create a pull request (PR) for each feature or bug fix.
   - Provide a clear description of the changes and their purpose.
   - Link the PR to relevant issues or tickets.

2. **Reviewer Assignment**

   - Assign at least two reviewers to each PR.
   - One reviewer should be familiar with the area of code being changed.
   - The other reviewer should be from a different team or area of expertise.

3. **Review Checklist**

   - Code adheres to our ESLint and Prettier configurations.
   - Proper error handling and logging are implemented.
   - Unit tests are included and pass.
   - Code is well-documented with clear comments and function descriptions.
   - No unnecessary code duplication.
   - Performance considerations are addressed.
   - Security best practices are followed.
   - Accessibility requirements are met.

4. **Feedback and Iterations**

   - Provide constructive feedback using GitHub's review features.
   - Address all comments and suggestions.
   - Re-request review after making significant changes.

5. **Approval and Merging**
   - Require at least two approvals before merging.
   - Resolve any merge conflicts before merging.
   - Use squash and merge to keep the main branch history clean.

## Refactoring Sessions

1. **Scheduling**

   - Hold bi-weekly refactoring sessions.
   - Rotate the focus area for each session (e.g., components, hooks, services).

2. **Preparation**

   - Team members submit code areas for refactoring consideration before the session.
   - Prioritize submissions based on impact and complexity.

3. **Session Structure**

   - 15 minutes: Review and select areas for refactoring.
   - 60 minutes: Collaborative refactoring (pair programming or mob programming).
   - 15 minutes: Review changes and discuss lessons learned.

4. **Follow-up**

   - Create PRs for the refactored code.
   - Assign reviewers and follow the standard code review process.

5. **Documentation**
   - Document major refactoring decisions and patterns in a shared knowledge base.
   - Update relevant documentation or comments in the code.

## Continuous Improvement

1. **Metrics Tracking**

   - Monitor code quality metrics (e.g., test coverage, cyclomatic complexity).
   - Track the number of bugs found in code review vs. production.

2. **Process Review**

   - Conduct a quarterly review of the code review and refactoring processes.
   - Gather feedback from team members and adjust guidelines as needed.

3. **Training and Knowledge Sharing**
   - Organize monthly "Lunch and Learn" sessions to share best practices and new techniques.
   - Encourage team members to present their learnings from conferences or courses.

By following these guidelines, we aim to maintain high code quality, promote knowledge sharing, and continuously improve our development practices.
